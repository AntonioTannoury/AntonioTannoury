## Hi there, I'm Antonio ðŸ‘‹
Something that really represents me is one of my favorite quotes:

_The most illogical thoughts often seem to be the most logical ones._

## A Mathematician, Researcher and Data Scientist!
Current Carrer precuisitions:
- Continuously creating and enhancing RAG chatbots workflows. 
- Working with transformers and fine-tuning models for specific business needs in NLP.
- Prompt engineering LLMs.
- Database handling, data analysis and EDA.

Life perspective:
- Continuously debating existencial aspects of life, and reflecting from/on Artificial Intenligence concepts (defining freedom if data was the main source of inteligence and decisions...).
- Maybe nothing more to share here on GithubðŸ™‚
